- Getting started guides should be clear step by step with as little explaination to what each step is.
- Don't solve potential errors before I've had a chance to encounter them.
- And don't explain your terminology in so much detail. I'll read about it when I have to.

I shall be adding 5 minutes of bust guides here.
